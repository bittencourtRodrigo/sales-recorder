## Sales Recorder - web application in Visual Studio community 2019

## Create states/districts, subsidiaries for each state and record sales. Backend: C#; Frontend: HTML, CSS and Js; Database: MySql; Additions: Entity Framework, .Net core 2.1 and ASP.NET Core MVC.

This project was inspired on [C# course](https://www.udemy.com/course/programacao-orientada-a-objetos-csharp/) by Professor [NÃ©lio alves](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nelio-alves/). It has the same purpose, but the path there was reasonably taken out of context by me, I ventured out to practice and shaped it my way. 

Topics you will find:
- Follows the Model-View-Controler pattern
- One function/method for each operation 
- MySql connection via Entity Framework
- Strong segmentation
- Custom error pages
- Error handling
- Startup dependency injection configuration
- MySql Dbset configuration
- Queries using LIQN and Lambda
- Search sales by minimum date and maximum date
- See here the [UML of the project](https://github.com/bittencourtRodrigo/sales-recorder/tree/master/ReadmeImages/UML)
